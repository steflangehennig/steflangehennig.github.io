<p>Parliamentary Monitoring Organisations [PMOs] seek to make legislators more accountable and reduce the potential moral hazards of delegation. This study of the UK finds that PMOs do reduce such hazards and make for greater ‘informatory’ accountability from MPs and Peers. The primary effect is on the House of Commons, and on individual MPs, where information seeking is most frequently local. The exact impact is variable, and depends on whether a Member is in government or opposition, how long they have served and, more subtly, whether they are male or female. The impact of PMOs is uneven, and can provoke resistance and gaming or fuel political conflict.</p>

<p>Has the increased flow of publicly available data helped or hindered democracy? Our findings suggest that transparency and openness is almost always seen as a ‘good’ thing. More data on what MPs and Peers are doing could bring a whole series of benefits. Not only would it help voters know more, as an essential prerequisite for a democracy, but it could also force greater accountability or even deter poor behaviour. However, context is often key, and making a place as politicised as Parliament more open could be unpredictable.</p>

Comparing Cosponsorship to Floor Voting in the Diffusion of Renewable Portfolio Policy.”</a> in <em>Policy Studies Journal</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Existing policy diffusion research has focused predominantly on analyzing collective decision-making at the point of policy adoption. In this project, we evaluate diffusion at the level of the individual legislator and specifically examine whether external cues play a stronger role in legislator decision-making when it comes to cosponsoring versus voting to adopt legislation. Leveraging a unique dataset of successful and failed bills of efforts across the American states to adopt renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) that spans roughly twenty-five years and includes thousands of observations, we provide an institutional corroboration to recent experimental work showing how ideological biases can be overcome, and reveal that interdependence exerts differential amounts of in influence at different points of the lawmaking process.</p>

<p>We examine whether the public’s approval of their state legislature reflect their satisfaction with the outputs of state government. We use survey responses from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study to consider the roots of public approval of state legislatures and find that people are more likely to voice approval of their state legislature when it produces policy outcomes congruent with their interests. Liberals view their state legislature more positively when policy outputs are liberal, while conservatives reward their state legislature when policy outcomes are conservative.  We also leverage the CCES’s panel data from 2012 to 2014 to show that changes in state policy liberalism inform changes in state legislative approval.</p>

Bell. “Congressional Capacity and Reauthorizations.” Chapter in <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo50700299.html"><em>Congress Overwhelmed: The Decline in Congressional Capacity and Prospects for Reform</em></a>, edited by Tim LaPira, Lee Drutman, and Kevin Kosar.</strong></p>
<p>The capacity of Congress to govern is increasingly a concern. In this paper we focus on one fundamental and sizable responsibility of lawmakers in Washington – renewing and updating the vast array of federal programs and agencies that are authorized for only a limited period of time and must be renewed periodically. Using the United States Code, we collect all legislative expirations and track their renewal over time. We reveal that expiring authorizations are more prevalent in some issue areas than in others. We also find that across the entirety of federal policy, Congress has increasing difficulty keeping up with the growing number of expired programs and agencies. Finally, we find that partisan divisiveness and public mood for more government activism within areas of federal policy are significantly related to Congress’s ability to renew expiring legislation. Our findings suggest that temporary authorizations reveal important information about what Congress capacity in a way not examined by previous research.</p>
<p><strong>Worthy, Ben and Stefani R. Langehennig. &ldquo;Continuous Virtual Surveillance? Monitory Democracy at Westminster.&rdquo; Chapter in <em>Parliament Buildings: The Architecture of Politics in Europe</em>, edited by Sophia Psarra, Claudia Sternberg, and Uta Staiger (forthcoming).</strong></p>
<p>We argue that the ‘virtual monitory space’ is seemingly more democratic than the often forbidding and exclusive physical environment of legislatures. Despite its openness, monitoring can only do so much to open up Westminster. Other work suggests that opening up a body can further obscure the ‘real facts’ of how an organisation functions, hiding the relationships, networks, skills and invisible processes through which it actually functions. However, we find that while the access enables access, scrutiny, and democratic accountability, it too is skewed and biased in important ways. Much depends on what or who is being observed, and the behaviour of those being watched, with assumptions over how politicians act in public or private, or how records are kept.</p>
